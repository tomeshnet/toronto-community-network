Thanks for getting in touch :)

Toronto Mesh has a [Code of Conduct](https://tomesh.net/code-of-conduct/) to help ensure we can work in a positive environment. Since you have indicated interest in contributing to the Toronto Community Network project, please familiarize and adhere to this Code.

The Toronto Community Network project is run by four working groups, which you can [read about here](https://github.com/tomeshnet/toronto-community-network/blob/master/README.md). As a contributor, you will join one or more groups of your choice, which involves a commitment to participate in regular meetings and in the project spaces, and to help further the group's objectives with other group members.

**Step 1** We use GitHub as a place to keep our files, and to track who is working on which project tasks. You can find tasks associated with each working group [here](https://github.com/tomeshnet/toronto-community-network/projects/1) for an idea of how this works. Please register on GitHub and send us your username so we can invite you to the working group(s).

**Step 2** The most important part of a community network is the community, and we'd like to spend regular face time where possible, to hang out and to work together. Please indicate your general availablity for standing meetings for the working group(s) where you would like to partcipate:

- [Communications and Community Engagement](https://www.when2meet.com/?9397727-snnPz)
- [Network Planning, Design and Operations](https://www.when2meet.com/?9397732-hLOdX)
- [Organizational and Program Governance](https://www.when2meet.com/?9397736-b9JNO)
- [Project Operations](https://www.when2meet.com/?9397742-spOMQ)

**Step 3** Reply to operations@tomesh.net to indicate your GitHub username and which working group(s) you would like to join. We will invite you to the GitHub Team associated with the group and add your email address to the group's email list.

**Optional** things you can do:

- Join our chat! It's a great way to stay connected with the many members of Toronto Mesh and the quickest way to get questions answered. We run a Matrix chat server with many active rooms, [follow the instructions on our website to join](https://tomesh.net/get-involved/).
- Join our [mailing list](https://lists.hypha.coop/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tomeshnet) and come to our regular [Meet and Greet](https://tomesh.net/events/) and other events.
- This is a lot of information and I don't know how to do ______ but I still want to contribute! Just send a message to operations@tomesh.net and we can peer you up with a member to walk through our tools and workflow.

Let's Mesh!
